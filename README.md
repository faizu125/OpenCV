# OpenCV
 This lab introduces basic image manipulation techniques using OpenCV. You'll learn how to copy, flip, and crop images, as well as change specific image pixels. Additionally, you'll explore how to draw shapes, add text, and superimpose images. These skills form a foundation for practical image processing tasks.
